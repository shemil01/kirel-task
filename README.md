# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`


Responsive:

I have implemented separate components for mobile and desktop views on both the home page and work page. The main page conditionally renders the appropriate component based on the device type, ensuring an optimized user experience across different screen sizes.

I have integrated the Framer Motion library into my project and implemented animations in several components, enhancing the visual appeal and user engagement throughout the application.
